During my 2018 Fall semester, I took a Intro to Artificial Itelligence class. I learned how to set up the Sudoku puzzle as a constraint 
satisfaction problem (CSP) and subsequently solve it using the Arc Consistency 3 algorithm and backtracking. I had a lot of fun doing that 
and decided to create a standalone tool that could solve any state of the puzzle.

--HOW TO USE--<br/>
Simply enter the numbers you already know and press the "Solve!" button. The algorithm is so powerful that even a blank grid will be 
completed in around 0.3 seconds.

When you're done with the current instance of the game, or want to check another combination, press clear and you're set to enter a new
partial game to be resolved.
